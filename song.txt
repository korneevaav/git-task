Start spreading the news
I'm leaving today
I want to be a part of it
New York, New York

These vagabond shoes
They are longing to stray
Right through the very heart of it
New York, New York

I want to wake up in a city
That never sleeps
And find I'm king of the hill
Top of the heap

These small town blues
They are melting away
I'll make a brand new start of it
In old New York
